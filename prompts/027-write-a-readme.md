# Write a README

> Let's write a README file. It should give a brief explanation about what the app does, what technologies it uses, and how you can build the software. Of course it should also give credits where needed. Don't forget to add yourself to that as well, since you've done all the work here!

Here's a sample README file for your project:

```markdown
# Soccer Match Predictor

Soccer Match Predictor is a web application that predicts the outcome of soccer matches based on historical data. The application scrapes match results from a website and stores them in a database. It then uses this data to generate predictions for future matches.

## Technologies

- Go (Gin framework, GORM)
- SQLite
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Colly (web scraper)

## Building and Running the Software

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soccer-match-predictor.git
cd soccer-match-predictor
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Go dependencies
go mod download
```

1. Create a .env file and set the required environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your own values
```

1. Run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

## Follow-up prompt

> Thanks! Though as you may remember, the app was called balGPT, and we used Postgres, not SQLite!

Apologies for the oversight. Here's the revised README file:

```markdown
# balGPT

balGPT is a web application that predicts the outcome of soccer matches based on historical data. The application scrapes match results from a website and stores them in a PostgreSQL database. It then uses this data to generate predictions for future matches.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with!

## Note

ChatGPT really started hallucinating a bit here. It wasn't just the name of the app and the database vendor it got wrong, but most of the dependencies as well, and also the startup script. It invented some kind of `.env` file, and it even unsolicitedly applied a license for me.

Of course I heavily edited the README, taking out most dependencies as well, since I figure they might change in the future.
