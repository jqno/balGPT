# Unit tests for database

It looks like you have several methods that are in need of unit tests. To accomplish this, we're going to need to mock the database interactions. One possible way to do this in Go is to use the `sqlmock` package. It allows us to set up a mock database connection and define expected interactions with it.

Please, note that I'm assuming that you have the `sqlmock` package already installed. If not, you can install it by running `go get github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock`.

Below are examples of unit tests for some methods:

```go
package database

import (
	"database/sql"
	"testing"
	"time"

	"github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock"
	"github.com/jqno/balGPT/internal/team"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestGetLastScrape(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	rows := sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"last_scrape"}).
		AddRow(time.Now())

	query := "SELECT last_scrape FROM stats ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1"
	mock.ExpectQuery(query).WillReturnRows(rows)

	_, err = database.GetLastScrape()
	assert.NoError(t, err)
}

func TestUpdateLastScrape(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	mock.ExpectExec("INSERT INTO stats (last_scrape) VALUES \\(\\$1\\)").
		WithArgs(sqlmock.AnyArg()).
		WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))

	err = database.UpdateLastScrape(time.Now())
	assert.NoError(t, err)
}

func TestFetchTeamsFromDB(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	rows := sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"id", "name"}).
		AddRow(1, "Team 1").
		AddRow(2, "Team 2")

	query := "SELECT id, name FROM teams"
	mock.ExpectQuery(query).WillReturnRows(rows)

	teams, err := database.FetchTeamsFromDB()
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.Equal(t, []team.Team{{ID: 1, Name: "Team 1"}, {ID: 2, Name: "Team 2"}}, teams)
}

```

In these examples, we are creating a mock database connection using `sqlmock.New()`. Then, we prepare our mock to expect a certain database operation such as `Query` or `Exec` with a certain query and arguments. We also specify what results it should return when that operation is performed. We then perform the operation and assert that the results are as expected.

You can use similar strategy to write tests for other methods in your database code.

Apologies for the confusion, the error you're facing is due to the special handling of escape characters in Go strings. The `\\` sequence is being interpreted as a single `\` character in the regular expression.

You can modify the ExpectExec as follows:

```go
mock.ExpectExec(`INSERT INTO stats \(last_scrape\) VALUES \(\$1\)`).
	WithArgs(sqlmock.AnyArg()).
	WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))

```

In the modification above, we are using backticks ``` to denote a raw string literal, where escape sequences are not processed. This allows us to write the regular expression without double escaping the backslashes. It should now match the SQL query as expected.

## Follow-up prompt

That gives me: `internal/database/database_test.go:40:38: unknown escape sequence`

Apologies for the confusion. The `ExpectExec` function from `sqlmock` package expects a regular expression, but doesn't require escaping parentheses or dollar signs. Here's how you can fix the `ExpectExec` call in your `TestUpdateLastScrape` test function:

```go
mock.ExpectExec("INSERT INTO stats \\(last_scrape\\) VALUES \\(\\$1\\)").
	WithArgs(sqlmock.AnyArg()).
	WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))

```

We need double backslashes here (`\\`) because we're inside a regular string, not a raw string. In a regular string, a backslash (`\`) is an escape character, so we need to escape it with another backslash. This results in `\\`, which represents a single backslash in the string.

Here is the corrected version of your test:

```go
func TestUpdateLastScrape(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	mock.ExpectExec("INSERT INTO stats \\(last_scrape\\) VALUES \\(\\$1\\)").
		WithArgs(sqlmock.AnyArg()).
		WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))

	err = database.UpdateLastScrape(time.Now())
	assert.NoError(t, err)
}

```

This should now correctly set the expectation for the SQL query in your test.

## Follow-up prompt

> Indeed, that works! Now please generate tests for the rest of the functions in the file.

Sure, let's continue with the remaining functions. Here are example unit tests for the rest of the methods:

```go
func TestInsertOrUpdateMatch(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT id FROM teams WHERE name = \\$1").
		WithArgs("Home").
		WillReturnRows(sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"id"}).AddRow(1))

	mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT id FROM teams WHERE name = \\$1").
		WithArgs("Away").
		WillReturnRows(sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"id"}).AddRow(2))

	mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT id FROM matches WHERE home_team = \\$1 AND away_team = \\$2 AND date = \\$3").
		WithArgs(1, 2, sqlmock.AnyArg()).
		WillReturnError(sql.ErrNoRows)

	mock.ExpectExec("INSERT INTO matches \\(home_team, away_team, home_goals, away_goals, date\\) VALUES \\(\\$1, \\$2, \\$3, \\$4, \\$5\\)").
		WithArgs(1, 2, 3, 2, sqlmock.AnyArg()).
		WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))

	err = database.InsertOrUpdateMatch("Home", "Away", 3, 2, time.Now())
	assert.NoError(t, err)
}

//... and so on for the rest of the methods.

// Make sure you handle both the positive case (where the method under test
// behaves as expected) and the negative case (where it encounters an error).
// For example, in `TestInsertOrUpdateMatch`, you might also want to test
// what happens when the `SELECT id FROM teams WHERE name = $1` query returns
// an error, or when the `SELECT id FROM matches WHERE...` query does not
// return `sql.ErrNoRows`, etc.

```

Writing good tests often involves thinking about what might go wrong as well as what the "happy path" through the code looks like. You'll want to make sure your code handles errors gracefully and behaves as expected in a variety of circumstances.

It's important to note that these are simplified tests and don't cover all edge cases or error scenarios. You might want to add more tests to cover more cases based on your business requirements.

Sure, I'll create the remaining tests based on the assumption of the success of the operations. Please note that real-world test cases should cover a variety of scenarios including errors, exceptions and edge cases. Also, the tests below may require modification depending on the specific behavior of your database and methods.

```go
func TestFetchTeamsFromDB(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	rows := sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"id", "name"}).
		AddRow(1, "team1").
		AddRow(2, "team2")

	mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT id, name FROM teams").WillReturnRows(rows)

	teams, err := database.FetchTeamsFromDB()
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.Len(t, teams, 2)
	assert.Equal(t, "team1", teams[0].Name)
	assert.Equal(t, "team2", teams[1].Name)
}

func TestGetTeamID(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	rows := sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"id"}).AddRow(1)

	mock.ExpectQuery("SELECT id FROM teams WHERE name = \\$1").WithArgs("team1").WillReturnRows(rows)

	id, err := database.GetTeamID("team1")
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.Equal(t, 1, id)
}

func TestAverageGoalsInLastMatches(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	rows := sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"AVG(goals)"}).AddRow(1.5)

	mock.ExpectQuery(".*").WithArgs(1, 5).WillReturnRows(rows)

	avg, err := database.AverageGoalsInLastMatches(1, 5)
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.Equal(t, 1.5, avg)
}

func TestLastYearMatchScores(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	rows := sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"home_goals", "away_goals"}).AddRow(2, 3)

	mock.ExpectQuery(".*").WithArgs(1, 2).WillReturnRows(rows)

	homeGoals, awayGoals, err := database.LastYearMatchScores(1, 2)
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.Equal(t, 2, homeGoals)
	assert.Equal(t, 3, awayGoals)
}

func TestGetCurrentSeasonLeaderboard(t *testing.T) {
	db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("an error '%s' was not expected when opening a stub database connection", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	database := DB{Conn: db}

	rows := sqlmock.NewRows([]string{"winner", "draw_team1", "draw_team2"}).
		AddRow(sql.NullInt64{Valid: true, Int64: 1}, sql.NullInt64{Valid: false, Int64: 0}, sql.NullInt64{Valid: false, Int64: 0}).
		AddRow(sql.NullInt64{Valid: false, Int64: 0}, sql.NullInt64{Valid: true, Int64: 2}, sql.NullInt64{Valid: true, Int64: 3})

	mock.ExpectQuery(".*").WillReturnRows(rows)

	result, err := database.GetCurrentSeasonLeaderboard()
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.Equal(t, map[int]int{1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1}, result)
}

```

These tests will cover the basic operations of the methods. In your production code, you will want to add more tests to handle other possible scenarios, especially error cases. These tests should serve as a starting point for further enhancements.
